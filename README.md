## Flag Game (Python)

This project is an interactive **Flag Game** built using **Python** and the **turtle graphics library**. Players are shown randomly drawn flags and must guess the country each flag represents.

The player starts with **3 lives**, and earns **points** for each correct guess. If the player guesses incorrectly, they lose a life. The game continues until the player either runs out of lives or correctly identifies all the flags.

### How the Game Works

1. A flag is drawn on the screen using the **turtle** module.
2. The player types in the name of the country they think the flag belongs to.
3. If the guess is correct, the player earns a point, and that flag is removed from the game.
4. If the guess is incorrect, the player loses a life.
5. The game ends when the player runs out of lives or identifies all flags correctly. Final points and remaining lives are displayed.

### Features

* Visual flag drawing with Python **turtle graphics**
* Supports multiple countries (India, Japan, Russia, France, Germany, Turkey, Morocco, Laos, Sweden, French Guiana, Finland, Gabon)
* Life-based system with **3 lives**
* Score tracking for correct guesses
* Interactive and educational gameplay to learn country flags

### Technologies Used

* Python
* `turtle` module
* `random` module

This project is perfect for beginners to learn **Python graphics**, **loops**, **conditional statements**, and **interactive input handling**, while also learning about world flags.
